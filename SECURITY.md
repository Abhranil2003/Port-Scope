# Port Scope Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within **Port Scope**, please follow the steps below to report it:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly.** Instead, report it privately to the maintainers.
   
2. **Email the maintainers** at [abhranilpoddar18@gmail.com](mailto:abhranilpoddar18@gmail.com) or use our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Abhranil2003/Port-Scope/issues) and mark it as private. Include the following information:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
   - Any relevant screenshots, logs, or data to help us understand the issue.
   
3. We take security vulnerabilities very seriously and will address the issue as soon as possible. Once we've fixed the vulnerability, we will release a patch and notify you of the fix. If the vulnerability affects a significant number of users, we may release a public advisory.

## Security Best Practices

Here are some best practices that we recommend for keeping your system and **Port Scope** secure:

- **Keep your environment up to date.** Ensure that you are using the latest version of **Port Scope** and that all dependencies are updated regularly.
- **Limit access to the tool.** Use firewalls, authentication, and access controls to limit who can run **Port Scope** in your network.
- **Audit and review reports regularly.** Make sure to regularly review the reports generated by **Port Scope** for any potential vulnerabilities or unauthorized access.
- **Avoid storing sensitive data unencrypted.** If you're storing scan results or logs, ensure they are stored securely and encrypted where necessary.

## Supported Platforms

**Port Scope** is designed to be cross-platform. However, we strongly recommend using it in a controlled environment such as:
- Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)
- macOS
- Windows (with WSL or similar)

Please ensure that your system has the latest security patches installed to minimize risks.
